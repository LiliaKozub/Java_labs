# Java_labs

## Description (Lab1, variant 9)

This repository contains Java lab work focused on matrix operations, such as matrix multiplication and calculating column averages. The project includes unit tests written using JUnit 4 to verify the correctness of the implemented operations.

## Requirements

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** version 8 or higher
- **JUnit 5** for running the tests

## How to Run the Project

### 1. Clone the repository using the following command:

    
    git clone https://github.com/LiliaKozub/Java_labs.git
    cd Java_labs
    cd lab1_java

### 2. Compile the Java files with this command:

    
    javac -d out/ src/lab_1/Main.java src/lab_1/MatrixOperations.java
    

### 3. Run the main application:

    
    java -cp out lab_1.Main
    

### 4. To run the unit tests, make sure you have the `Java_labs` directory, then:
To run the tests, open the project directory through the IDE. In IntelliJ IDEA, you can simply right-click on the test directory or individual test classes in the tests folder and select Run 'All Tests' or Run 'TestName'.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the implementation of basic matrix operations and their validation through unit testing.

## Description (Lab2, variant 9)

This project involves creating a Java class that includes an executable method designed to perform actions on a given text string and an array of words. The main objective is to count how many sentences contain each word from the array

## Requirements

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** version 8 or higher
- **JUnit 5** for running the tests
- **Apache Maven** 3.6.0 or higher

## How to Run the Project

### 1. Clone the repository using the following command:

    
    git clone https://github.com/LiliaKozub/Java_labs.git
    

### 2. Navigate to the lab2_java directory


     cd Java_labs/lab2_java
     

### 3. Compile and package the project with Maven


     mvn clean package


### 4. Run the compiled JAR file:


     java -jar target/untitled2-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

## Description (Lab3, variant 9)

This lab implements an NPC character management system for games. The project allows you to create, save and sort NPCs by various criteria such as name, role, level and agility. The user can enter details for each NPC, view a list of created characters, and search for identical NPCs in the list.

## Requirements

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** version 11 or higher
- **JUnit 5** for running the tests
- **Apache Maven** 3.6.0 or higher

## How to Run the Project

### 1. Clone the repository using the following command:

    
    git clone https://github.com/LiliaKozub/Java_labs.git
    

### 2. Navigate to the lab3_java directory


     cd Java_labs/lab3_java
     

### 3. Compile and package the project with Maven


     mvn clean package


### 4. Run the compiled JAR file:


     java -jar target/untitled2-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar


### 5. To run the tests, use:


     mvn test

## Description (Lab4)

This project is focused on processing text elements such as sentences, words, punctuation, and letters. The main functionality includes counting the number of occurrences of specific words in a set of sentences. The project also includes a set of unit tests to verify the correctness of the implementation. 

## Requirements

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** version 11 or higher
- **JUnit 5** for running the tests
- **Apache Maven** 3.6.0 or higher

## How to Run the Project

### 1. Clone the repository using the following command:

    
    git clone https://github.com/LiliaKozub/Java_labs.git
    

### 2. Navigate to the project directory


     cd Java_labs/lab4_java
     

### 3. Build the project


     mvn clean package


### 4. Run the project:


     java -jar target\lab4_java-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar


### 5. To run the tests, use:


     mvn test


## Documentation
